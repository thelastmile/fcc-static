The goal of this project is to be able to use all FreeCodeCamp exercises while offline. (for those exercises where it makes sense, e.g. not ones that rely on a cloud service)

Additionally, we would like to use the JSON format that defines the exercises to make additional exercises

It should support running on a single computer without any network access, by storing progress in local storage, but could also be enhanced to support saving to a configurable local network server with a basic user authentication and storage service.
